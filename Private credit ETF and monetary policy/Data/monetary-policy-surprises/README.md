# Monetary Policy Surprises

The code in the R script `mps.R` calculates monetary policy surprises from data in the
U.S. Monetary Policy Event-Study Database (USMPD).

## Instructions

1. Download latest version of `USMPD.xlsx` from https://sffed.us/usmpd
2. Open R session and set working directory to folder with `mps.R`
   -> This folder should contain `USMPD.xlsx`
3. Ensure all required R packages are installed, for example using the command
   `install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "lubridate", "readr"))`
4. Run script mps.R, for example using the command
   `source("mps.R")`

## Output

The code writes two separate CSV files, which contain monetary policy surprises constructed with the
methodology of Acosta et al. (2025). The *units* of the underlying high-frequency money market futures
rate changes, as well as the daily one-year Treasury yield changes, are percentage points. The surprises are
normalized so that they have a one-for-one impact on the one-year Treasury yield.

`mps.csv` contains three different surprises, for the statements (STMT), press conferences (PC) and monetary
events (ME) after FOMC meetings.

`mps_minutes.csv` contains the surprises for releases of the FOMC meeting minutes.

## Target and Path Factors

The script `gss.R` calculates target and path factors from the statement surprises, following the methodology
of Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005). The target factor captures surprise changes in the current federal
funds rate target, and the path factor captures changes in expected future policy that are orthogonal to
current target changes. The target factor is normalized to move MP1 one-for-one, and the path factor is
scaled so that its effect on the one-year-ahead futures rate (ED4) is the same as the target factor's effect.
